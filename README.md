This project is a Task Management Web Application built with a React frontend and an Express backend connected to a MongoDB database. It allows users to register, log in (including GitHub OAuth login), and manage tasks with different priorities.

## Changes and Additions from Assignment #3

Migrated frontend to React.

Integrated Express backend with React by serving the production build from the server.

Deployed to AWS EC2 instance.

Implemented GitHub OAuth with proper redirect flows in both local and deployed environments.

Used tmux for server process management on EC2.

Configured MongoDB connection securely with environment variables.

This assignment is focused on ensuring the project is fully functional, deployed, and accessible.
